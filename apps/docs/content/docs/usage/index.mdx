This guide walks you through using Inboxorcist to clean up your Gmail inbox.

## Getting Started

After deploying Inboxorcist, you can access the web interface at your configured URL (e.g., `http://localhost:6616` for local deployments).

## Workflow Overview

```
1. Connect Gmail → 2. View Statistics → 3. Select Categories → 4. Start Deletion → 5. Monitor Progress
```

## Key Features

### Email Statistics

See how many emails you have in each category:
- **Promotions** - Marketing emails, newsletters
- **Social** - Social network notifications
- **Updates** - Automated notifications, receipts
- **Primary** - Important personal emails
- **Custom Labels** - Your Gmail labels

### Bulk Deletion

Delete thousands of emails at once:
- Select one or more categories
- Preview the count of emails to be deleted
- Start the deletion job
- Monitor real-time progress

### Background Processing

Large deletions run as background jobs:
- Continue using the app while deletion runs
- Jobs are resumable if interrupted
- View progress and estimated time remaining

### Trash Management

After deletion, emails go to Gmail's Trash:
- Emails in Trash are permanently deleted after 30 days
- Use "Empty Trash" to delete immediately
- Recover emails from Trash if needed
