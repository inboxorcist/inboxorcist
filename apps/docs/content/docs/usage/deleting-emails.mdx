Inboxorcist lets you delete thousands of emails at once, organized by Gmail categories.

## Understanding Categories

Gmail automatically sorts your emails into categories:

| Category | Contents | Typically Safe to Delete |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| **Promotions** | Marketing, deals, newsletters | Yes |
| **Social** | Social network notifications | Yes |
| **Updates** | Automated messages, receipts | With caution |
| **Primary** | Personal, important emails | No - review first |

<Callout type="warn">
  Always review what's in a category before deleting. Gmail's categorization isn't perfect.
</Callout>

## Viewing Email Statistics

After connecting Gmail, the dashboard shows:

- **Total emails** across all categories
- **Count per category** (Promotions, Social, Updates, etc.)
- **Storage used** (if available)

Click on a category to see more details.

## Deleting by Category

### Step 1: Select Categories

On the main dashboard:
1. Check the categories you want to clean
2. Multiple categories can be selected

### Step 2: Review Count

Before starting:
- See the total number of emails to be deleted
- Confirm you want to proceed

### Step 3: Start Deletion

Click **Delete Selected** to start the job.

### Step 4: Monitor Progress

The progress screen shows:
- **Emails processed** - How many have been moved to Trash
- **Remaining** - How many are left
- **Estimated time** - Based on current speed

## How Deletion Works

### Background Processing

Large deletions run as background jobs:
- You can close the browser
- The job continues on the server
- Check back anytime for progress

### Batch Operations

Emails are deleted in batches:
- Gmail allows 1000 emails per batch
- Batches are processed sequentially
- Rate limits are handled automatically

### Soft Delete

Emails are moved to Trash, not permanently deleted:
- **30 days** to recover from Trash
- Use "Empty Trash" for immediate deletion

## Emptying Trash

After moving emails to Trash:

1. Go to **Settings** or the Trash section
2. Click **Empty Trash**
3. Confirm the action

<Callout type="error">
  This permanently deletes all emails in Trash. This cannot be undone.
</Callout>

## Job Management

### View Running Jobs

The dashboard shows active deletion jobs:
- Current progress
- Start time
- Status

### Cancel a Job

To stop a running deletion:
1. Go to the job status page
2. Click **Cancel**
3. Already-deleted emails remain in Trash

### Resume Interrupted Jobs

If a job is interrupted (server restart, network issue):
- Jobs automatically resume on next start
- No emails are lost or duplicated

## Rate Limits

Gmail has API quotas to prevent abuse:

| Limit | Value | What Happens |
| ----- | ----- | ------------ |
| Requests per second | 250 | Automatic retry with backoff |
| Daily quota | ~1 billion units | Unlikely to hit for personal use |

Inboxorcist handles rate limits automatically:
- Exponential backoff on errors
- Respects Gmail's throttling
- Jobs continue when limits reset

## Best Practices

### Start Small

For your first deletion:
1. Start with a smaller category (like Social)
2. Verify emails went to Trash
3. Then proceed with larger categories

### Don't Delete Primary

The Primary category often contains important emails. Either:
- Skip it entirely
- Manually review in Gmail first

### Keep Receipts

The Updates category may contain:
- Purchase receipts
- Account confirmations
- Travel itineraries

Consider reviewing before bulk deletion.

### Regular Cleanup

For ongoing inbox management:
- Run Inboxorcist monthly or quarterly
- Delete Promotions and Social regularly
- Be more selective with Updates

## Recovering Deleted Emails

If you accidentally deleted emails:

### From Trash (within 30 days)

1. Open Gmail
2. Go to **Trash**
3. Select emails to recover
4. Click **Move to** > **Inbox**

### From Gmail Admin (Google Workspace)

Workspace admins can recover emails up to 25 days after Trash deletion.

### After 30 Days

Unfortunately, emails permanently deleted from Trash cannot be recovered.

## Troubleshooting

### Deletion is Slow

Normal causes:
- Large number of emails
- Gmail rate limiting
- Network latency

The progress bar shows estimated time.

### Job Stuck at 0%

Check:
- Gmail connection is still valid
- Server logs for errors
- Try reconnecting Gmail

### Some Emails Not Deleted

Possible reasons:
- Emails moved to different category during deletion
- Gmail's categorization changed
- Rate limit reached (will resume)

### Trash Not Emptying

If "Empty Trash" fails:
- Check Gmail connection
- Try again after a few minutes
- Check server logs for errors
