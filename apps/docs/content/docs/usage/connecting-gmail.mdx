Connect your Google account to allow Inboxorcist to manage your emails.

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Open Inboxorcist

Navigate to your Inboxorcist instance in a web browser:
- Local: `http://localhost:6616`
- Cloud: Your deployment URL

### 2. Click "Connect Gmail"

On the home page, click the **Connect Gmail** button to start the OAuth flow.

### 3. Sign in to Google

You'll be redirected to Google's sign-in page:
1. Select your Google account (or sign in)
2. If you have multiple accounts, choose the one you want to clean

### 4. Review Permissions

Google will show you the permissions Inboxorcist requests:

| Permission | Why It's Needed |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| View your email messages | To count emails per category |
| Modify your email messages | To move emails to Trash |

<Callout type="info">
  Inboxorcist only requests the minimum permissions needed. It cannot send emails or access other Google services.
</Callout>

### 5. Grant Access

Click **Allow** to grant the requested permissions.

### 6. Return to Inboxorcist

After authorization, you'll be redirected back to Inboxorcist. Your Gmail is now connected.

## Verification Warning

If your app is in "Testing" mode (not verified by Google), you may see a warning:

> "This app isn't verified"

This is normal for self-hosted applications. To proceed:

1. Click **Advanced**
2. Click **Go to [App Name] (unsafe)**

<Callout type="warn">
  This warning appears because your OAuth app hasn't been reviewed by Google. For personal use, this is safe to bypass since you control the application.
</Callout>

## Managing Connection

### Check Connection Status

The dashboard shows your connection status:
- **Connected** - Gmail is linked and working
- **Disconnected** - Need to reconnect

### Disconnect Gmail

To unlink your Gmail account:

1. Go to **Settings** (or click your profile)
2. Click **Disconnect Gmail**
3. Confirm the action

This removes your OAuth tokens from Inboxorcist.

### Reconnect

If your connection expires or you disconnected:

1. Click **Connect Gmail** again
2. Follow the authorization flow
3. Tokens are refreshed automatically

## Token Refresh

Gmail OAuth tokens expire after 1 hour. Inboxorcist handles this automatically:

- Tokens are refreshed in the background
- No action required from you
- If refresh fails, you'll be prompted to reconnect

## Multiple Accounts

Currently, Inboxorcist supports one Gmail account at a time. To switch accounts:

1. Disconnect the current account
2. Connect the new account

## Revoking Access

To completely revoke Inboxorcist's access:

1. Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
2. Find "Inboxorcist" in the list
3. Click **Remove Access**

This immediately invalidates all tokens.

## Troubleshooting

### "Access blocked: This app's request is invalid"

The redirect URI doesn't match. Ensure the redirect URI in Google Cloud Console matches `${APP_URL}/auth/google/callback` exactly.

### "Error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch"

Same cause as above. Check:
- Protocol: `http` vs `https`
- Port number
- Trailing slashes

### "This app isn't verified"

Normal for self-hosted apps. Click **Advanced** > **Go to [App Name]**.

### "Authorization Error"

Possible causes:
- User cancelled the authorization
- Token expired during flow
- Try again from the beginning

### No Emails Showing After Connect

Wait a moment for the initial sync. If nothing appears:
1. Check you authorized the correct Google account
2. Verify permissions were granted
3. Try disconnecting and reconnecting
