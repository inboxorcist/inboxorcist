## Manual Deployment

### Step 1: Create a New Project

1. Log in to [Railway](https://railway.app)
2. Click **New Project**
3. Select **Deploy from GitHub repo**
4. Connect your GitHub account and select the Inboxorcist repository

### Step 2: Configure Build Settings

Railway auto-detects the Dockerfile. Verify settings:

- **Builder**: Dockerfile
- **Dockerfile Path**: `docker/Dockerfile`
- **Watch Paths**: Leave default

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

Go to **Variables** and add:

```bash
# Required
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=GOCSPX-your-secret

# Security (generate these)
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-min-32-chars
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-64-character-hex-encryption-key

# App URL (your Railway domain)
APP_URL=https://your-app.up.railway.app
```

Generate secrets:

```bash
# JWT_SECRET
openssl rand -base64 32

# ENCRYPTION_KEY
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### Step 4: Deploy

Click **Deploy** or push to your repository. Railway will build and deploy automatically.

### Step 5: Update Google OAuth

After deployment, update your Google OAuth redirect URI to match your Railway URL:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Edit your OAuth client
3. Add your Railway URL to Authorized redirect URIs:
   ```
   https://your-app.up.railway.app/auth/google/callback
   ```

## Adding PostgreSQL (Optional)

For larger mailboxes, add a PostgreSQL database:

1. In your Railway project, click **New**
2. Select **Database** > **Add PostgreSQL**
3. Railway automatically sets `DATABASE_URL` in your service

## Custom Domain

1. Go to **Settings** > **Domains**
2. Click **Generate Domain** or **Add Custom Domain**
3. Update environment variables and Google OAuth redirect URI accordingly

## Monitoring

### View Logs

Click on your service and select **Deployments** to view build and runtime logs.

### Check Metrics

Railway provides CPU, memory, and network metrics in the **Metrics** tab.

## Updating

Railway automatically deploys when you push to the connected branch. To manually redeploy:

1. Go to **Deployments**
2. Click **Redeploy**

## Pricing

Railway offers a free tier with:
- $5 of usage credits per month
- 500 hours of execution time

For larger mailboxes or persistent databases, consider their paid plans.

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

Check build logs in the **Deployments** tab. Common issues:
- Missing Dockerfile at specified path
- Network issues pulling base images

### App Crashes on Start

Check runtime logs for environment variable validation errors:
- Ensure all required variables are set
- Verify `JWT_SECRET` is at least 32 characters
- Verify `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is exactly 64 hex characters

### OAuth Errors

Ensure your Google Cloud Console redirect URI matches `${APP_URL}/auth/google/callback`:
- Must use `https://` (Railway provides HTTPS automatically)
- Must match exactly: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/auth/google/callback`
