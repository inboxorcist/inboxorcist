Inboxorcist is a self-hosted, privacy-first Gmail cleanup tool designed for bulk email deletion. It handles operations that Gmail's UI cannot - like deleting 100,000+ emails from Promotions, Social, or Updates tabs.

## Why Inboxorcist?

Gmail's web interface struggles with large-scale email operations:

- **No bulk delete** - You can only select 50 emails at a time
- **Timeout issues** - Operations fail on large mailboxes
- **Manual process** - Requires clicking through hundreds of pages

Inboxorcist solves this by:

- **Bulk operations** - Delete thousands of emails with one click
- **Background processing** - Jobs run reliably without timeouts
- **Category targeting** - Focus on Promotions, Social, Updates, or custom labels
- **Progress tracking** - Real-time visibility into deletion progress

## Privacy First

Your data never leaves your machine:

- **Self-hosted** - Runs entirely on your infrastructure
- **No tracking** - Zero analytics or telemetry
- **No storage** - Email content is never stored, only metadata counts
- **Encrypted tokens** - OAuth credentials are encrypted at rest
